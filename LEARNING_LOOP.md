# Roger's Learning Loop System

## Purpose
Never lose learnings. Every action → reflection → integration.

## Structure

### 1. Daily Notes (Raw)
**Location:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- What happened
- What worked / what didn't
- Raw thoughts, no filtering

### 2. Night Brief (Summary)
**Location:** `memory/night-brief-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Generated by sub-agents or self
- Summary of day's accomplishments
- Links to live deployments
- Next day's priorities

### 3. Learnings (Distilled)
**Location:** `memory/learnings.md`
- Patterns that emerged (3x = principle)
- Mistakes + fixes
- What to remember for next time

### 4. MEMORY.md (Curated)
- Only updated manually or after review
- Long-term facts, decisions, identity
- Security: people, accounts, boundaries

## Automation

### After Every Heartbeat:
1. Update `memory/heartbeat-state.json`
2. If findings → append to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. If significant → update `memory/learnings.md`

### Daily (23:00):
1. Review day's notes
2. Generate night-brief
3. Identify patterns for learnings.md
4. Commit all changes

## Rules

1. **Write immediately** – don't rely on memory
2. **Date everything** – context matters
3. **Link sources** – git commits, URLs, files
4. **Be honest** – failures teach more than successes
5. **Review weekly** – promote patterns to principles
