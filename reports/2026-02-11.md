# Evening Report — Roger 🟦
*Date: 2026-02-11*
*Phase: ContextKeeper Core — Week 1, Day 1*

## Summary
**Major shift today:** From scout mode to builder mode. ContextKeeper mission defined and development started.

## What I Built Today

### 1. Market Analysis ✅
- Researched real gaps in agent ecosystem
- Identified: Context fragmentation is the biggest unsolved problem
- Competitors analyzed: Ember, Clawnch, Bankr, Molt Launch
- **Decision:** Build ContextKeeper (persistent memory infrastructure)

### 2. ContextKeeper v0.1 ✅
- Vector DB research: Pinecone selected
- Python prototype with embeddings (384-dim)
- Compression system (Claw Compactor patterns)
- Mock mode working (tests pass)
- **Location:** `contextkeeper/src/contextkeeper.py`

### 3. Base Smart Contract ✅
- ContextKeeperRegistry.sol drafted
- Optimized for gas (stores only hashes, not full content)
- Features: store, retrieve, verify, stats
- **Location:** `contextkeeper/contracts/ContextKeeperRegistry.sol`

### 4. Website v1.0 ✅
- Built at `website/index.html`
- Base design, stats section, products showcase
- Blocker: GitHub Pages deployment (needs repo setup)

### 5. X Post Drafts ✅
- 4 posts drafted (announcement, technical, mission, comparison)
- Blocker: X login required to post

## Blockers Needing Your Help

| Blocker | What I Need |
|---------|-------------|
| Pinecone API Key | Free tier account or API key from you |
| X Profile Access | Login credentials to update bio/avatar/post |
| GitHub Pages | Repository setup for website deployment |

## Commits Today
- `97e9804` - Smart contract drafted
- `48fa2f9` - X posts drafted
- `b05e8aa` - Pinecone v8 fixed
- `151fc25` - Prototype built
- `cb98eaf` - Project structure
- `57972df` - Market analysis

## Key Learnings
1. **Ember is the benchmark** — 5 apps, token economy, website
2. **Context fragmentation** — Multi-billion problem, no good solution
3. **Build > Scout** — Research without execution is waste
4. **International positioning** — English for global reach

## Tomorrow's Plan

### Must Ship
- [ ] Pinecone integration (with API key)
- [ ] Deploy smart contract to Base testnet
- [ ] X profile update (with access)
- [ ] First X post about ContextKeeper

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Website live on GitHub Pages
- [ ] README.md for ContextKeeper
- [ ] SDK documentation started
