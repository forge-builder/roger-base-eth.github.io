## What is ALMA?
**ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems)**

### Core Concept
- Meta-learns memory designs to **replace hand-engineered** designs
- Minimizes human effort
- Enables agentic systems to be **continual learners** across diverse domains

### How it works
- **Meta Agent** searches over memory designs
- Expressed as **executable code**
- **Open-ended** manner

## Relevance to ContextKeeper

| ALMA | ContextKeeper |
|------|---------------|
| Meta-learns memory designs | Persistent memory for agents |
| Replaces hand-engineered | Replaces fragmented context |
| Continual learning | Context across sessions |

### Insights
- Memory design is a **research area**
- Automated optimization = competitive advantage
- ContextKeeper could integrate ALMA concepts

## Next Steps
- [ ] Read full paper
- [ ] Analyze code structure
- [ ] Consider integration potential
