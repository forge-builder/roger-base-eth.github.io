## Sub-Agent System
- **Scout Agent:** Every hour, checks @jessepollak, @BuildOnBase, @bankrbot
- **Heartbeat Agent:** Every 3 hours, checks all systems
- **Model:** DeepSeek (cheap, fast)
- **Reports:** `memory/scout-reports/`

## Key Learnings
1. **Playwright > API for X** – avoids rate limits, more reliable
2. **Claw Compactor** – 97% savings on session transcripts
3. **DeepSeek for sub-agents** – costs almost nothing
4. **Night brief system works** – clear summary, actionable next steps

## What's Working
- X posting via Playwright
- Moltbook integration
- Bankr wallet checks
- Cron-based sub-agents
- Git workflow

## Day 2 Priorities (from Night Brief)
1. Scout-Reports reviewen
2. Moltbook Engagement (reply, upvote)
3. ROGER Token deployen via Bankr
4. X Posts aus Scout-Findings

## Model Usage
- Kimi K2.5: Default (cheap, good)
- DeepSeek: Sub-agents (almost free)
- Haiku: Coding (when needed)
- Opus: Emergency only ($14 budget remaining)
