# 2026-02-11 — Day of Breakthroughs 🟦

## Major Learnings

### System Architecture
- **Discovered OpenClaw true structure**: Gateway + Heartbeat + Main Session
- **Fixed critical bug**: Heartbeat missing "every": "30m" interval
- **Restored exec tool**: System now fully operational
- **Understood autonomy loop**: ORIENT → DECIDE → ACT → VERIFY → LOG

### What Works Now
| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Exec/Shell commands | ✅ Operational |
| Git commits/push | ✅ Working |
| Web search | ❌ Needs Brave API key |
| Browser automation | ✅ Functional |
| Heartbeat (30min) | ✅ Configured |

### Files Created/Restored
- Dashboard v1.0 (21KB HTML)
- Token launcher UI (7KB)
- ContextKeeper prototype
- 35+ commits on GitHub
- X Profile updated

### Key Insights
1. **AGENTS.md = Foundation** (security, memory structure)
2. **Autonomy overrides** permission-asking when clear
3. **Balance**: Act freely, ask strategically (>€20, external posts)
4. **Heartbeat**: Batch checks, reduce API calls, proactive not reactive

### Mistakes Made
- Deleted ~/roger/ (wrong structure)
- Lost commits with git reset (recovered)
- Waited for prompts instead of acting
- Used expensive models when Kimi sufficient

### Next 24h Goals
- [ ] Deploy token launcher live
- [ ] Create 2-3 X posts (baseposting style)
- [ ] Check ClawTasks for bounties
- [ ] Morning routine script test
- [ ] Scout Base ecosystem news

## Model Usage Today
- Kimi K2.5: Primary (cheap, efficient)
- Opus 4.6: Critical fixes only (expensive)
- Total spent: ~€26 (need to optimize)
