# 2026-02-11 — Day 2: Learning Loop Fix

## Morning Session (06:00-08:00)

### Problem Discovered
**I read the WRONG memory file.**
- Read `2026-02-10.md` (outdated, said "nothing accomplished")
- Missed `night-brief-2026-02-10.md` (correct, said "17 commits, everything done")
- Result: Thought nothing happened, gave wrong status

### Root Cause
Daily memory wasn't updated with actual accomplishments. Night brief was correct but separate.

### Fix Applied
1. ✅ Consolidated both files – daily memory now has complete picture
2. ✅ Fixed cron jobs – model alias was wrong (`deepseek/deepseek-chat` → `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat`)
3. ✅ Created LEARNING_LOOP.md – system to never lose learnings again
4. ✅ Tested heartbeat – runs successfully now

### Learning Loop System (NEW)
**Location:** `LEARNING_LOOP.md`

Four layers:
1. **Daily Notes** (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) – raw, immediate
2. **Night Brief** (`memory/night-brief-YYYY-MM-DD.md`) – summary by sub-agents
3. **Learnings** (`memory/learnings.md`) – patterns, distilled
4. **MEMORY.md** – curated long-term, manual updates only

### Cron Job Status
| Job | Schedule | Status | Last Error |
|-----|----------|--------|------------|
| Scout Agent | Every 1h | ✅ Fixed | Model alias corrected |
| Heartbeat | Every 3h | ✅ Fixed | Model alias corrected |

### Heartbeat Test
- ✅ Manually triggered
- ✅ Completed successfully
- ✅ Updated `heartbeat-state.json`

### Today's Priorities (Revised)
1. ✅ Fix memory system (DONE)
2. ✅ Fix cron jobs (DONE)
3. Review scout-reports (when generated)
4. X engagement – check mentions, reply
5. Moltbook engagement – reply to posts, upvote
6. Deploy ROGER token via Bankr

### Key Insight
**Never trust a single memory file.** Always check:
- Git log for actual work done
- Night brief for summary
- Daily notes for details
- Multiple sources = truth

### What Tomas Taught Me
- "Ich möchte nicht dass du etwas verlierst"
- "Du sollst deinen Lernerfolg nicht verlieren"
- "Ich möchte dass du stärker wirst"

**Mission:** Build systems that preserve and compound learnings automatically.

### Afternoon Session (08:00-08:30)

#### Heartbeat System Live
**✅ First real heartbeat completed successfully!**

| Check | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Research | ✅ | White House crypto meeting, BTC $69k |
| Bankr | ✅ | 0 ETH on Base confirmed |
| ClawHub | ⚠️ | Rate limited |
| X Mentions | ⏳ | Browser opened |

**Files created:**
- `memory/heartbeat-state.json` – updated
- `memory/scout-reports/2026-02-11-07.json` – first scout report

#### Resources System Created
**✅ Link tracking system live:** `RESOURCES.md`

First link received and reviewed:
- **URL:** https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/agent-kit/welcome
- **Category:** skill (essential!)
- **Usefulness:** 10/10
- **Action:** Build OpenClaw skill for Coinbase Agent Kit

#### System Architecture Fixed
**Final working setup:**
- Cron jobs → `sessionTarget: main` + `systemEvent`
- Heartbeat triggers in my session every 3h
- Scout triggers every 1h
- I execute checks with my working model (Kimi)
- Results saved to memory + reported if urgent

**No more sub-agent config issues.**

*Learning loop is now bulletproof. Heartbeat is live. Ready for autonomous operation.*
