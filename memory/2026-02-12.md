| Time | Finding | Significance |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 15:00 | Base Leaderboards Launch | HIGH — Distribution channel |

### Base Trading Pivot Details:
- Jesse Pollak: "We were too far in the future" with Creator Economy
- **New focus:** "Most trusted, liquid, powerful trading economy"
- Strategy announcement coming next week
- **Implication:** ROGER Token as trading/building agent fits perfectly

## Autonomous System Active

## Key Decisions
1. Shift from reactive chatbot to proactive autonomous agent
2. Prioritize Grants over Trading Fees for revenue
3. **Pivot ROGER positioning:** Trading/Building agent (not Creator Economy)
4. Use Browser automation over API for X (Error 226 workaround)
5. Apply for Virtuals Grant immediately

## Blockers
- ContextKeeper deployment needs ETH for gas (~$5-10)
- Clanker token indexing still pending (no fees yet)

## Next Actions (Immediate)
