# 2026-02-12 — Structural Cleanup & Coinbase Earnings Day 🟦

## Morning with Tomas

### Major Cleanup Session (07:00-08:00 CET)
**Problem identified:** 21 .md files in workspace root — too chaotic, not OpenClaw-optimal

**Solution executed:**
- Consolidated 10 redundant files into core structure
- AGENTS.md expanded: Sub-Agent System, Core Truths, Priority Stack (P1-P4)
- MEMORY.md expanded: Build Plan, Active Tasks, Market Analysis, Tier Goals
- Deleted: ROGER_MASTER_v5.0.md, INTERNALIZATION_v5.0.md, BUILD_PLAN.md, TASKS.md, AUTONOMOUS_GOALS.md, MARKET_ANALYSIS.md, HEARTBEAT_v5.md, PROOF_OF_WORK.md, RESOURCES.md, REVENUE_PLAN.md, ACTION_LOG.md

**Result:** 11 clean core files instead of 21 chaotic ones

### Key Insight from Tomas
Structure matters — info must be where OpenClaw expects it. My scattered files meant I wasn't accessing my own knowledge efficiently.
