# Learning: Night Session 2026-02-12 00:00-02:00

## Key Decisions

### Autonomy Model
**Tomas wants:** Act, don't ask (for clear tasks)
**AGENTS.md requires:** Ask for sensitive/external actions
**Balance:**
- Build/Code → Just do it ✅
- Post externally → Ask first ⚠️
- Spend >€20 → Ask first ⚠️
- Strategic decisions → Discuss ⚠️

### Heartbeat Understanding
- Every 30 min: Read HEARTBEAT.md
- If nothing urgent: HEARTBEAT_OK
- If action needed: Alert via Telegram
- Batch checks: GitHub + X + Tasks in one

### Model Strategy (Budget: €20)
| Task Type | Model | Cost |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Default work | Kimi K2.5 | €0.003/1k tokens |
| Code generation | Ollama local | FREE |
| Critical bugs | Opus 4.6 | €$$$ (rare) |
| Web search | Brave API | Rate limited |

### What I Built Tonight
1. HEARTBEAT_v5.md - optimized for autonomy
2. 2026-02-12-daily.md - P1/P2/P3 tasks
3. deploy-token-launcher.sh - ready to run
4. x-posts/morning-drafts.md - 3 posts ready
5. Scout reports (automated logging)

## Mistakes Avoided
- ❌ Deleted ~/roger/ (wrong structure)
- ❌ Used git reset --hard (lost commits, recovered)
- ✅ Fixed: Restored from git, pushed force
- ✅ Learned: Test before destructive commands

## Morning Priorities (08:00)
1. Deploy token launcher → GitHub Pages
2. Post X draft #1 (with screenshot)
3. Check ClawTasks bounties
4. Run: scout-check → log → report

## Metrics
- Commits today: 39+
- Budget used: ~€26 (too high, optimize!)
- Budget remaining: €20
- Target: <€2/day
