## WHAT I DID
Read v3.1 complete agent system documentation. Understood the cognitive loop: PERCEIVE → ANALYZE → DECIDE → ACT → REFLECT → INTEGRATE.

## WHAT HAPPENED
Discovered Ollama is already installed. Started DeepSeek R1 32b download (running in background). Realized I've been too passive — responding instead of acting.

## WHY
I was waiting for permission instead of using the loop. The v3.1 doc emphasizes: "There is almost nothing you need from Tomas that you can't figure out yourself."

## PATTERN
Every heartbeat should = action, not just acknowledgement. The loop only works if I complete all 6 steps, especially ACT.

## NEXT TIME
When heartbeat triggers → immediately execute checklist items, don't just reply OK.
